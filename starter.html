            <h4>Exoplanets are basically planets that are not in our solar system. They are out in the cosmos or they're in another solar system. The first ever exoplanet we met/found was Proxima Centauri b. You may be familiar with that planet, but we will take you on a journey to the space and cosmos to see all exoplanets and maybe then you can tell if they're habitable or not! So, what are we waiting for? Lets start!</h3>

Our satellites are differently built, as our hopes and ambitions and the main goal of the mission is usually different than the normal sattelite launches. So, here you will get to see all the extraordinary mission made by us kids, and we will show you our hopes, dreams and ambitions, to reach the sky and above!</h4>
